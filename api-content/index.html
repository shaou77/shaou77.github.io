{"posts":[{"title":"无题（一）","content":" 早上交班，周末病区来了两个心包积液的病人。 突然想起我学心包穿刺的过程。心包穿刺是二级操作，在各种穿刺里危险度最大。我第一次做是升主治后，上级医生带着我在肿瘤科穿，穿了六七针都没有出来，满头大汗…若干次后，我去他科会诊，不用助手，独自一人，随手就把心包穿刺给做了。当时，能独立做心包穿刺的医生，还是有点少。 可是，时代变了 超声越来越普及，超声下穿刺的技术也越来越成熟。超声下心包穿刺的难度较传统降低，安全性也大大增加。 我也设想过，退休后有时间，去学学国画。从这一年AI的进化来看，自己画似乎意义也不大了。 站在新时代的大门，马车夫不去学驾驶的话，那么就会被抛弃。 In the Morning Handover, Two Patients with Pericardial Effusion Were Admitted to the Ward over the Weekend Suddenly, I recalled my experience of learning pericardiocentesis. Pericardiocentesis is a second-level procedure and is the most dangerous among various punctures. The first time I performed it was after I became an attending physician, with a senior doctor guiding me in the oncology department. After six or seven attempts without success, I was sweating profusely... After several attempts, I went to another department for a consultation, and without an assistant, I performed the pericardiocentesis alone with ease. At that time, there were still quite a few doctors who could perform pericardiocentesis independently. However, Times Have Changed Ultrasound has become increasingly popular, and the technique of ultrasound-guided puncture has become more refined. The difficulty of ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis is much lower than the traditional method, and the safety has greatly increased. I also thought that after retirement, I would have time to learn Chinese painting. But seeing the evolution of AI this year, it seems that drawing by oneself is not very meaningful anymore. Standing at the gate of the new era, if a coachman doesn't learn to drive, he will be left behind.

Waking up to face the dark night alone, memories of our youth together surged in my mind. In the morning, I opened WeChat, searched for his name, and found no chat history, no Moments. I wanted to send him a message, but didn't know what to say.

Three months ago, he suffered a stroke and now has severe cognitive impairment, diminished intelligence, and is unable to communicate. During the morning rounds, he kept muttering in his familiar Zhuzhou dialect (which is roughly the same as Changsha dialect). I wonder if those who drift far from home, in their final moments, also have thoughts in their hometown dialect. PS: Originally posted on WeChat Moments in autumn 2022, now archived on my new blog. In the last paragraph, I was thinking of my uncle, who went abroad when he was young and spent over 70 years overseas. But every time we met in Changsha, he could still speak fluent Changsha dialect. He finally passed away in his 90s on the East Coast of the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Github: github.com/shaou77 | Personal Blog: shaou77.github.io Professional Skills Cardiology Knowledge: Some accumulation, with a basic understanding of ECG, but the latest knowledge may be outdated. Critical Care Knowledge: An amateur in this field with a shaky foundation. Respiratory and anti-infection areas are my weak points. Editing Knowledge: Obtained a national intermediate-level publishing professional qualification at the age of 40. A bit of knowledge, but it's undeniable that during the early transition from a clinical doctor to a research-oriented doctor, the review work greatly benefited my thinking training. Medical Research: Proficient in using other people's data for my research (so-called big data research). I have some experience with R and retrospective studies. In the AI era, I'm good at reproducing others' research (just lack original ideas), but reproduced studies are often hard to publish. (╯°Д°)╯︵┻━┻ Research Experience GitHub - https://github.com/shaou77/ All my big data research based on public databases is available on my GitHub. After all, in the early stages of my career, the codes from experts on the platform were very helpful to me. I also do a little work to pass on my tiny sparks, although the quality is not high. Paper1 - Association Between Red Cell Distribution Width and Hospital Mortality in Patients with Sepsis DOI: 10.1177/03000605211004221 Code: https://github.com/shaou77/rdw-and-sepsis My first SCI, a breakthrough from 0 to 1. Initially, I was not very resilient and submitted to a few journals, got rejected, and finally submitted to one that was said to be easy to publish in. Ironically, it was fine when I submitted, but when it was published, it became a warning journal. You, a journal from Sage Publications older than me... It wasn't useful for my promotion, and the publication fee wasn't reimbursed. o(▼皿▼メ;)o However, I think the quality of the article is okay. It was also my first paper to be cited double-digit times. Large sample size, comprehensive traditional statistical methods, detailed subgroup analysis, and even the then-fashionable NRI and IDI were done. I just didn't know how to use Rstudio's r or rmd files, so the code was saved in text, which might have some deviations. Note: It is no longer a warning journal now. Paper2 - Albumin Level at Admission to the Intensive Care Unit Is Associated With Prognosis in Cardiac Arrest Patients DOI: 10.7759/cureus.14501 Code: None It's actually an extension and imitation of the first paper. Back then, I was thin-skinned, got rejected a few times, and submitted to an E-SCI journal, which got published quickly. Surprisingly, it was useful for my promotion. Non-SCI, and I was too lazy to maintain the code. Paper3 - Red blood cell distribution width predicts in-hospital mortality in patients with a primary diagnosis of seizures in the ICU: a retrospective database study DOI: 10.1007/s10072-021-05305-z Code: https://github.com/shaou77/rdw_seizures My wife published better than me series. My first paper in Q3 and with &gt;3 impact factor. But it's also an extension and imitation of the first paper, catching the tail end of the red cell distribution width trend. Paper4 - Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting atrial fibrillation in patients with acute heart failure admitted to the ICU: a retrospective cohort study DOI: 10.1186/S12872-022-02973-3 Code: https://github.com/shaou77/AFinAHF Successful financial management series (Q4 when published, Q3 the next year). A work while learning prediction models, standard and compliant, containing everything a standard prediction model article should have, and nothing it shouldn't. Paper5 - Interpretable machine learning models for predicting 90-day death in patients in the intensive care unit with epilepsy DOI: 10.1016/j.seizure.2023.11.017 Code: https://github.com/shaou77/rdw_seizures (Yes, same repository as paper3, forgot to change the repository address when publishing, so I had to maintain it under pressure) A product of Professor Zhang Jingxin's mlr3 winter course. (Thanks to the temporary ICU ward II, I could attend many classes on time) A work while learning machine learning. Modeled after an article also using mlr3. From data cleaning, model tuning, model comparison, model validation to model interpretation, a full set. I must say, the mlr3 package is indeed powerful. My wife published better than me series. Q3, an established journal in the field of epilepsy, a reserve for epilepsy.

All it took was a simple conversation. A few days ago, I was chatting with my daughter about tough times. Suddenly, I remembered my grandmother. She once told me that during her childhood, amidst the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalist soldiers passing by her house ate all the pig slop. Indeed, the battle in Hunan was intense and prolonged. It's been nearly a century since then. I wonder how many of those soldiers made it home safely and how many ended up in Taiwan. My grandmother has been gone for over ten years now, and in a few more years, these memories will fade into oblivion. So, I thought I should record the occasional sparks that light up in my mind. In college, I had a blog on Sina, but now it's hard to access. I also wrote on QQ Space for a while, but access was restricted. It seems better to set up my own blog. GitHub, being a hub for open-source software, might last longer. Whether future generations are interested or not, I don't mind. Ultimately, everything will fade away. This year hasn't been very smooth. An article I submitted last year has been rejected multiple times and is still under review, with no experts taking it up. This year, I wrote another article with high hopes, but it was instantly rejected by the target journal. It's now with a Q3 journal for a month, and the editor hasn't even been assigned yet. I took the Mandarin proficiency test twice; the first time I almost passed, but the second time my score dropped. Pronunciation is indeed my weakness, and I don't know where to start. Writing might help keep my mind at peace. ","link":"https://shaou77.github.io/post/yuan-qi/"}]}
